Guideline for what should be propagated:
________________________________________

Clients: clients.clients list holds all nodes, defos propagated
Blockchain: blockchain.chain, difficulty
BlockPool: Does not need to be propagated, BlockPool resets each block
WalletPool: Holds all wallet addresses, should be propagated
TransactionPool: defs propagate tx's
Coinbase: Calc to find supply? or just propagate?
    def isValid(self, block):
        try:
            previousblock = self.chain[-1]
        except IndexError:
            return True

        if block.previous == previousblock.get_hash():
            return True

        else:
            return False
