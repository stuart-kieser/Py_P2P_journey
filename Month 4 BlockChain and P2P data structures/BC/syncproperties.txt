Guideline for what should be propagated:
________________________________________

Clients: clients.clients list holds all nodes, defos propagated
Blockchain: blockchain.chain, difficulty
BlockPool: Does not need to be propagated, BlockPool resets each block
WalletPool: Holds all wallet addresses, should be propagated
TransactionPool: defs propagate tx's
Coinbase: Calc to find supply? or just propagate?
