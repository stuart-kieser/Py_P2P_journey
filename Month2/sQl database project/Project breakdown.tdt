Tenant register app:
1. Create a flask application that can be used in a building,
    this web app should be able to add users, remove users, have user move rooms
2. users should have abilty to login, request maintenance (with text block), request room changes 
    this request room changes should only show the rooms that are empty or missing one person. 
3. The app should feature some rudimentary contract system that they must sign, when a user is removed this contract must be removed
4. A rolling counter of how long the tenant has lived in the building should also be stored in the db 

I think this is a good place to start, i also think ill add styling to the webapp but first i will manage a functioning back and front end. 

What pages may i require:
Home page
Register page
Login page
User page
Admin page with more access
    admin page should allow or disallow room transfer
