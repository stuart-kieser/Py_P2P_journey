# Data structures
"""
Method of organizing data
instead of a=1 b=2 c=3
list = 1, 2, 3

linked list 
pointers to different node

each data element has a pointer to the net data element

types of data structures:

linear data structures:

    arrays are an example of this
        data is stored sequentialy after each other

    stack data structures 
        add the latest bit of data to the top of the file there fore it is likely to be removed first

    queue data structures
        opperate on FIFO
        first in first out

    linked list data structure
        data is connected through a series of nodes
        each node contains data items of previous node        

Non linear data structures
    no sequence is required
    arranged in hierarchical manner

    graph data structure
        each node is a vertex and is connected to other nodes through verticies

    Trees Data Structure
        in a tree structure each node can only have two children. 
        there are different types of trees

"""
"""
Dictionary operations in python

unordered collection of data values

store data values like map
    has key:value pair
    indexing of a dictionary is done with keys

    a dictionary basically lets you create an 
    sql like stucture where you can tie data, 
    variables or strings to a specific number or id

    
Set operations in python

unordered collection of data that doesnt allow duplicates. 


Bytearray operations in python
    gives a mutable sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256
